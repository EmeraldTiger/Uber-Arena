# Uber Arena
Uber Arena is a modification for Quake 3 that adds several new game
mechanics and items to the standard Quake 3 game. There are no changes to
the fundamental, core principles of Quake 3, but merely additions that aim to
revitalize the arena shooter formula while maintaining the challenge and intensity
that Quake is known for. There are no loadouts or special abilities - all players
still start out equal and must fight tooth-and-nail to take control of the arena
using a variety of different skills, just as they have before.
